# React POC template

To begin developing with this repo, enter these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Install dependencies:
yarn

# Initialize git:
git init

# Run the application:
yarn start
```

You can then open the web app in a browser: http://localhost:1234

Changes you make will be automatically reflected in the browser

This lightweight template uses [React](https://reactjs.org/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), & [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) for development and packaging as well as [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.

To share my POCs, I love to publish on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
